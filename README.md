# K-Means


K-Means is a popular cluster algorithm widely used in various fields for data
analysis. Its centroid-based nature enables the simple way of assignment of
each given instance into any of the found clusters.

To find more information about this algorithm, have a look at the 
[Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering).

This implementation is not meant to be used in a production environments,
because it uses just the simple Python means; no usage of NumPy or any other
scientific and compute performance optimized library. The purpose of this 
project is to be rather educational and not for being used in any mission 
critical applications.
